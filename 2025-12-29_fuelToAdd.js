=== Inputs ===
Given the numbers of:
- gallons of fuel currently in your airplane
- liters of fuel required to reach your destination

=== Output ===
determine how many additional gallons of fuel you should add.

=== Functional ===
1 gallon equals 3.78541 liters.
If the airplane already has enough fuel, return 0.
You can only add whole gallons.
Do not include decimals in the return number. */

function fuelToAdd(currentGallons, requiredLiters) {
  let reqGallons = requiredLiters / 3.78541;
  let addGallons = Math.ceil(reqGallons - currentGallons);

  return Math.max(addGallons, 0);
}

/* 
=== Why build it this way? ===
The only catch in this challenge is that one test fails with Math.round().
This meant an implied requirement to always round up or down wasn't stated
in the brief.
A quick correction to Math.ceil() passes all tests.
