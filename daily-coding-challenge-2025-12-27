=== Inputs ===
Given two strings, 
the first representing Player 1 and 
the second representing Player 2, 
determine the winner of a match of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The input strings will always be
"Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".

=== Functionality ===
"Rock" beats "Scissors".
"Paper" beats "Rock".
"Scissors" beats "Paper".
Return:

=== Output ===
"Player 1 wins" if Player 1 wins.
"Player 2 wins" if Player 2 wins.
"Tie" if both players choose the same option. 

=== My solution === */

function rockPaperScissors(player1, player2) {
  let options = {
    Rock: 0,
    Paper: 1,
    Scissors: 2,
  };
  let results = [
    "Tie",
    "Player 1 wins",
    "Player 2 wins"
  ];

  let p1 = options[player1];
  let p2 = options[player2];
  let result = (p1 - p2);

  return results.at(result);
}

=== Why did I build it this way? === 
1.  I wanted to keep input and output definitions clearly grouped so that options
    and outcomes were clear to the reader. In essence self documenting the shape
    of the function.

2.  I was curious to explore what patterns emerged that consistently indicate
    winning or losing outcomes for the players.
    I considered whether:
    1.  some always positive-and-even AND negative-and-odd
        relationship could exist between the input pairs after subtraction, but be
        inversed for each player.
    2.  some use of unique primes to represent player 1 and 2 inputs might yeild
        unique outputs which can be easily interpreted for selecting the winner.
        I intended to use this with modulo to simmer down to a value between 0-2,
        where each could be tied to the 3 outputs specified in the brief.

    UNUSUAL FINDING:
    I found during exploration that excel modulo and js modulo behave differently with
    negative numbers, where excel modulo always produces a positive number - and infact
    always the same number for function "=MOD((p1 - p2), selector)" which was a nice
    trick. This find was a delightful find, but ultimately unnecessary, as point 2.1
    above turned out to be true, and js accepts negative indexes in arrays.

3.  I found this end solution elegant and clear, and exploits a not so obvious, but
    simple, relationship between player choices.

4.  Finally the challenge led me to consider a linear-algebraic solution, and whether
    that could be exploited for zero-sum cyclic games with infinite players, or
    infinite choices
    Some investigation suggests yes, and I'd like to build that function out
    in the future.
